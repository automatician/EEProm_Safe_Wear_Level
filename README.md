# EEProm_Safe_Wear_Level: for Industrial Data Integrity with Log-Management

**Library Version: v25.10.5**

This library provides a **fool-proof solution** for the persistent, reliable storage of critical data on Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. It covers the entire application spectrum, from simple EEPROM storage in the $\mu\text{C}$ to verifiable data logging required at a commercial level.

---
## üõ°Ô∏è Design Conformity with Industry Standards

The architecture of this library follows the highest design requirements from the fields of functional safety and software quality:

### IEC 61508 / ISO 26262 (Functional Safety Principles)
The design ensures the safety of critical data through **comprehensive CRC validation** and **error reporting**. The entire wear-leveling logic is aimed at preventing hardware failure, which is a direct measure to increase system reliability and longevity.

### ISO/IEC 5055 (Reliability & Maintainability)
The library achieves maximum transparency and maintainability. The internal encapsulation of complexity and the **clear separation of logical reading and error reporting** ensure maximum transparency, which are the cornerstones of this quality standard.

## What It Is: Complete Data Management Subsystem

`EEProm_Safe_Wear_Level` is a **complete data management subsystem** with integrated error handling, multi-partition support, logging functionality, and comprehensive auditability. Its strategic goal is to **GUARANTEE data integrity** under critical conditions while maximizing the lifespan of the EEPROM (WEAR-LEVELING).

It meets the high requirements for **robustness and failure safety** needed in commercial or critical projects.

## Key Features of v25.10.5

| Feature | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FAILURE SAFETY** | Each data record is secured with a checksum and is verified after saving. Corrupted sectors are reported (see Diagnostics). |
| **CRC with High Detection Rate** | Enhanced CRC checksums for robust detection of data corruption within the EEPROM itself. |
| **LOGGING FUNCTIONALITY** | Enables secure chronological data logging with API access to the newest/oldest entries and with record navigation. | 
| **LONG LIFESPAN (Wear-Leveling)**| Utilizes a **Ring Buffer** to spread write cycles evenly, significantly increasing EEPROM endurance. |
| **TYPE-SAFE I/O** | Generic templates for structs, all primitive types, and C-Strings via dedicated overloads. |
| **MULTI-PARTITION** | Independent management of multiple logical data areas (Handles 0, 1, 2, ...). |
| **RAM Handle Protection** | Securing control data structures (RAM Handle Structure) against corruption. |
| **CONFIGURABLE COUNTERS** | Adapt health functionality and control data overhead (between 2 and 5 bytes). |
| **DATA MIGRATION** | Memory-saving transfer of log entries to a second partition to prevent log loss upon saturation. |
| **DIAGNOSTICS** | Detailed **8 Status Codes** (0x00 to 0x07) allow a targeted response to errors and log states. |
