 # **EEProm_Safe_Wear_Level Library v25.10.5** 
* **ðŸ’Ž EEProm_Safe_Wear_Level: Gold Standard for Industrial Data Integrity**<br>
This library is a **fool-proof solution** for the persistent storage of critical data on microcontrollers. It has been developed to meet the strict requirements for reliability and robustness demanded by the industry.
* **ðŸ“– Design Conformity with Industry Standards**
The architecture of this library follows the highest design requirements from the fields of functional safety and software quality:
* **IEC 61508 / ISO 26262 (Functional Safety):** The design ensures the safety of critical data through **automatic error skipping** (Status Code 1) and comprehensive **CRC validation**. The entire wear-leveling logic is aimed at preventing hardware failure, which is a direct measure to increase reliability.
* **ISO/IEC 5055 (Reliability & Maintainability):** The internal encapsulation of complexity, the clear `read(0)/read(1)` API pattern, and the **8 detailed status codes** (e.g., Code 7 for Log End) ensure maximum transparency and maintainability, which are the cornerstones of this quality standard.
**Conclusion:** If you are looking for a library that **guarantees data integrity** and **longevity** across the entire lifecycle of your embedded system, this is the **Gold Standard**.

 ### It covers the entire application spectrum, from simple storage in the EEPROM in the Arduino ÂµC to verifiability data at the commercial level.
ðŸ“– The complete manual with public functions, parameters and return values in [API Manual](MANUAL.md).

ðŸ“– Starts directly with detailed example codes that will get you to your goal quickly:
 * [Demo1: String in an array](Examples/demo1_type_char_array.ino)
 * [Demo2: Store pure states or measured values â€‹â€‹(numbers, Booleans)](Examples/demo2_type_int.ino)
 * [Demo3: Store logical grouping of different but related data in structures](Examples/demo3_type_struct.ino)
## **WHAT IT IS**

 * A complete data management subsystem with integrated error handling,
  multi-partition support, logging functionality, and comprehensive
  auditability.

* Meets the high requirements for robustness and failure safety
  needed in commercial or critical projects:

  *  Detection of data corruption / security within the EEPROM itself.

  *  Prevention of overwriting program memory in case of faulty
    application.

  *  Securing control data structures (RAM Handle Structure)
    against corruption (overwriting / data modification).

  *  CRC checksums with an increased detection rate.

## 1. PURPOSE & KEY FEATURES (ROBUSTNESS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EEProm_Safe_Wear_Level library serves as a **complete DATA MANAGEMENT
SUBSYSTEM**. Its strategic goal is not only to maximize the lifespan of the
EEPROM (**WEAR-LEVELING**), but also to GUARANTEE **data integrity** under
critical conditions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. KEY FEATURES OF v25.10.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **TYPE-SAFE I/O:** Generic templates for structs and all primitive types. 
C-Strings are additionally supported via a dedicated overload: write(const char*)

* **FAILURE SAFETY:** Each data record is secured with a checksum.
  Corrupted sectors are ignored.

* **WRITE SAFETY:** Checking and error feedback for write operations.

* **LONG LIFESPAN:** Wear-Leveling via a **Ring Buffer**.

* **CONFIGURABLE COUNTERS:** Precisely adapt the health functionality
  to your program requirements and control the data overhead in the EEPROM,
  between 2 bytes and 5 bytes.

* **MULTI-PARTITION:** Independent management of multiple logical
  data areas (Handles 0, 1, 2, ...).

* **DIAGNOSTICS:** Detailed error codes (0x01 to 0x05) allow a
  targeted response.

* **LOGGING FUNCTIONALITY:** Loading physical data records (sectors) and their
  control possibility (log end, log beginning).

* **MEMORY-SAVING DATA MIGRATION:** Transfer of log entries to a second partition
   in case of logical saturation of the original partition so that it can be reset
   (no log loss) in just a few steps.
